Dracula theme for appchanx

![text](./preview.png)

## How to install

### 1. Install appchanx (you can refer to here <https://zixaphir.github.io/appchan-x>)  

The version above is very outdated and it will require some tweaks to get it working on both 4chan and 4channel due to captcha changes.

### 2. Import xxxx-settings.jsons

Note: I am using "Hack" font

### 3. Import theme

Done
